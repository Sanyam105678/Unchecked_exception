
Q1. A checked exception is  compile time exception it means it is detected at compile time
whereas unchecked exception is detected at runtime.
Checked exception can be handled by try catch whereas unchecked exception can't be handled, it is simply a runtime time exception.
We can just instruct user to solve it by giving a hint.
